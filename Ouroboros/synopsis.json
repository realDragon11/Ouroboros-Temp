    "description": "Adds looping jobs. This is a temp fix version while I'm having computer issues.",
    "description_long": "Loopable Jobs:\n*Glover and Glover (unless you are climbing the ranks- ambition prevents you from settling in. Will also stop every time your job situation changes.)\n*Manual Labor\n*Physican Job\n*Multiple Books at Morlands (up to 4 at a time)\n\nLooping requires reason or health, depending on the job- since normally you'd have to wait for them on cooldown.\nCredit to Kv√≤the for original mod and the one altered image in the mod."
